#  Notes App

A full-stack notes management app built with Spring Boot (Java) for the backend and Register & Login using username or email
-  JWT-based token authentication
-  Create, Read, Update, Delete notes
-  View your previous notes after logging in
-  Clean UI with minimal inline styling (React)
-  Ready for deployment (Firebase frontend, backend deployable to services like Render or Railway)

Used React for a simple frontend interface.

Mainly made to practice spring boot backend and security. You can test it locally with MongoDB running on default port 
(mongodb://localhost:27017). Either use postman after running the spring backend or run the react app to interact through frontend.
